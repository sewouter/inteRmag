#' @description Well the only reason I started this page was for me to access
#' the index of functions by typing ?inteRmag. I should add stuff.
#' Stuff. Stuff. Stuffy old STUUUUFFFFFF !!!!!!
#' Man I thought I handled the pandemic better. Apparently my outlet is obscure
#' R packages description files. I mean who the hell is going to read this
#' anyway ? If anyone: I'm in the last year (hopefully!) of my PhD, don't judge
#' me too harshly.
